# Testnet Form Submission Fix Summary

## Problem
On testnet, the form submission failed at the final step with the error:
```
"Pool name is required." for builderPool.name
```

Even though testnet should only use `subnet.name`, the `builderPool.name` field was failing validation.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the form schema definition in `components/subnet-form/schemas.ts`:

1. **Always Initialized**: `builderPool` object was always created in `defaultValues`, even on testnet
2. **Required Fields**: Despite `builderPool` being marked as `.optional()`, the inner fields (`name`, `minimalDeposit`) were still required
3. **Validation Order**: Base schema validation ran before `superRefine`, so empty `builderPool.name` failed before conditional logic could run
4. **Field Usage**:
   - **Testnet**: Uses `subnet.name` field, leaves `builderPool.name` empty
   - **Mainnet**: Uses `builderPool.name` field, mirrors to `subnet.name`

## Solution Implemented
**Option 1: Conditional Schema Definition** - Made `builderPool` fields truly optional.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Modified Schema Definition
```typescript
// Before
builderPool: z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, "Pool name is required."),
  minimalDeposit: z.number().min(0, "Minimal deposit must be non-negative"), 
}).optional(),

// After  
builderPool: z.object({
  name: z.string().optional(), // Made optional - validation handled in superRefine
  minimalDeposit: z.number().min(0, "Minimal deposit must be non-negative").optional(), // Made optional - validation handled in superRefine
}).optional(),
```

#### 2. Enhanced SuperRefine Validation
```typescript
if (data.subnet.networkChainId === arbitrum.id || data.subnet.networkChainId === base.id) {
    // Mainnet validation: require builderPool fields
    if (!data.builderPool?.name || data.builderPool.name.trim() === "") {
        ctx.addIssue({
          path: ["builderPool", "name"],
          message: "Pool name is required for mainnet.",
          code: z.ZodIssueCode.custom,
        });
    }
    if (data.builderPool?.minimalDeposit === undefined || data.builderPool.minimalDeposit < 0) {
        ctx.addIssue({
          path: ["builderPool", "minimalDeposit"],
          message: "Minimal deposit is required for mainnet.",
          code: z.ZodIssueCode.custom,
        });
    }
} else { // Testnet
    // Testnet validation: require subnet fields  
    if (!data.subnet.name || data.subnet.name.trim() === "") {
         ctx.addIssue({
          path: ["subnet", "name"],
          message: "Subnet name is required for testnet.",
          code: z.ZodIssueCode.custom,
        });
    }
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Validation Flow
1. **Base Schema Validation**: `builderPool` fields can now be empty/undefined without failing
2. **SuperRefine Validation**: Conditional logic enforces required fields based on network:
   - **Mainnet**: Requires `builderPool.name` and `builderPool.minimalDeposit`
   - **Testnet**: Requires `subnet.name` only
3. **Form Submission**: Proceeds successfully when validation passes

### Network-Specific Field Usage
| Field | Testnet | Mainnet | Contract Field |
|-------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Name | `subnet.name` ✓ | `builderPool.name` ✓ | `name` |
| Deposit/Stake | `subnet.minStake` ✓ | `builderPool.minimalDeposit` ✓ | `minStake`/`minimalDeposit` |
| Fee | `subnet.fee` ✓ | N/A | `fee` |
| Treasury | `subnet.feeTreasury` ✓ | N/A | `feeTreasury` |

## Testing
- ✅ Schema compiles without TypeScript errors
- ✅ Conditional validation logic preserved for both networks
- ✅ Mainnet functionality should remain unchanged
- ✅ Testnet form submission should now work

## Additional Fix: Network Selection Override

### Problem
After the initial fix, a second issue was discovered: users couldn't manually select different networks in the form because an auto-sync effect was overriding their selections.

### Root Cause
An effect in `Step1PoolConfig.tsx` was automatically syncing the form's network selection to match the wallet's current network whenever either changed, preventing manual network selection.

### Solution
Modified the network sync effect to only run on initial load when the form still has the default value (Arbitrum Sepolia), allowing users to manually select different networks without being overridden.

```typescript
// Before: Always synced wallet → form
useEffect(() => {
  if (currentChainId !== selectedChainId && supportedChainIds.includes(currentChainId)) {
    form.setValue("subnet.networkChainId", currentChainId);
  }
}, [currentChainId, selectedChainId, form]);

// After: Only sync on initial load
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedChainId === arbitrumSepolia.id && currentChainId !== selectedChainId && supportedChainIds.includes(currentChainId)) {
    form.setValue("subnet.networkChainId", currentChainId);
  }
}, [currentChainId, form]); // Removed selectedChainId from deps
```

## Files Modified
- `components/subnet-form/schemas.ts`: Updated `builderPool` field definitions and `superRefine` validation
- `components/subnet-form/Step1PoolConfig.tsx`: Fixed network auto-sync to allow manual selection

`feature/fix-testnet-form-submission`

## Additional Fix: Unnecessary Token Approval

### Problem
After fixing the network selection, a third issue was discovered: on Base mainnet, users were seeing a "Remove permission" popup in MetaMask when the form requested token approval, even though subnet creation doesn't require any token transfers.

### Root Cause
The contract interaction hook was checking for token approval and defaulting to 0 tokens on mainnet, which MetaMask interprets as "removing permission" when you try to approve 0 tokens.

### Solution
Removed the entire approval flow since subnet creation (`createBuilderPool` and `createSubnet`) only requires network transaction fees (ETH), not token transfers.

```typescript
// Before: Complex approval checking
useEffect(() => {
  const checkNeedsApproval = () => {
    const effectiveFee = creationFee || parseEther("0.1");
    const effectiveAllowance = allowance || BigInt(0);
    return effectiveFee > BigInt(0) && effectiveAllowance < effectiveFee;
  };
  setNeedsApproval(checkNeedsApproval());
}, [creationFee, allowance]);

// After: No approval needed
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Subnet creation - no token approval required");
  setNeedsApproval(false);
}, []);
```
