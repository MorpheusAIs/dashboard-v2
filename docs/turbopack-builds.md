Next.js build performance can be critical for both development (`next dev`) and production (`next build`) environments, especially as projects grow in size and complexity. Below, I’ll outline the best strategies to speed up Next.js builds, with a focus on Turbopack and other proven techniques. I’ll incorporate insights from recent web sources and X posts where relevant, and address why these methods work, especially in light of your recent fix.

### Why Next.js Builds Can Be Slow
Next.js builds involve compiling JavaScript/TypeScript, bundling assets (e.g., CSS, images), and optimizing for server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), or client-side rendering (CSR). Common bottlenecks include:
- **Large Dependency Trees**: Heavy dependencies or unoptimized imports (e.g., importing entire libraries like `react-icons`).
- **File Watching**: Inefficient file system watching, especially on WSL2 or large projects.
- **CSS Processing**: Slow CSS compilation, especially with Tailwind or CSS-in-JS.
- **Complex Codebases**: Large numbers of pages, components, or dynamic imports.
- **Outdated Tools**: Older versions of Next.js or Webpack-based builds.

Your recent fix (removing mixed exports) likely improved **development-time** Fast Refresh, but production builds or dev server startup may still need optimization. Let’s explore the best approaches.

### Best Ways to Speed Up Next.js Builds

#### 1. Use Turbopack for Development
   - **What It Is**: Turbopack is a Rust-based bundler designed as a faster successor to Webpack, integrated into Next.js for development (`next dev --turbo`). It’s optimized for incremental builds, faster Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and lower memory usage.
   - **Why It Helps**: 
     - **Incremental Compilation**: Only rebuilds changed files, reducing HMR times to milliseconds (up to 96.3% faster code updates for large apps like vercel.com).[](https://nextjs.org/blog/turbopack-for-development-stable)
     - **Rust Performance**: Rust’s efficiency speeds up compilation and reduces memory usage compared to Webpack’s JavaScript-based processing.[](https://meetpan1048.medium.com/next-js-turbopack-the-ultimate-tool-for-lightning-fast-development-af626e1f97e8)
     - **Lazy Bundling**: Only bundles what’s needed for the current route, improving dev server startup (up to 76.7% faster).[](https://nextjs.org/blog/turbopack-for-development-stable)
   - **How to Implement**:
     - Ensure you’re using Next.js 15 or later (Turbopack is stable for `next dev` as of Next.js 15).[](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1j9omtt/anyone_know_how_to_make_turbo_actually_work_it/)
     - Update `package.json`:
       ```json
       {
         "scripts": {
           "dev": "next dev --turbo",
           "build": "next build",
           "start": "next start"
         }
       }
       ```
     - Add `turbo: {}` to `next.config.js` to enable Turbopack configuration:
       ```js
       /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
       const nextConfig = {
         turbo: {},
       };
       module.exports = nextConfig;
       ```
     - If using custom Webpack configs, migrate to Turbopack-compatible settings, as Webpack configs can cause conflicts.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1j9omtt/anyone_know_how_to_make_turbo_actually_work_it/)
   - **Caveats**:
     - Turbopack is stable for development but not yet for production builds (`next build`).[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/turbopack)
     - Some Webpack plugins or loaders (e.g., `Contentlayer`) may not work; test compatibility or remove them.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1j9omtt/anyone_know_how_to_make_turbo_actually_work_it/)
     - If you encounter slowdowns (e.g., as reported in Next.js 15.2.0+), generate a trace file to debug:
       ```bash
       NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1 next dev --turbo
       ```
       Share the `.next/trace.log` file on GitHub Discussions or Vercel Community for analysis.[](https://nextjs.org/docs/14/architecture/turbopack)
   - **When to Use**: Ideal for speeding up `next dev` in development, especially for large projects. If you’re already on Next.js 15, this should significantly improve HMR and dev server startup, building on your Fast Refresh fix.

#### 2. Optimize Dependency Imports
   - **Why It Helps**: Large or unoptimized dependencies (e.g., importing entire icon libraries) increase bundle sizes and compilation times. Optimizing imports reduces the work Next.js does during builds.
   - **How to Implement**:
     - **Use Specific Imports**: Avoid importing entire libraries. For example:
       ```js
       // Bad: Imports all icons
       import { TriangleIcon } from '@phosphor-icons/react';
       // Good: Imports only the needed icon
       import { TriangleIcon } from '@phosphor-icons/react/dist/csr/Triangle';
       ```
       Check library docs for specific import paths (e.g., `react-icons`, `@material-ui/icons`).[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/local-development)
     - **Dynamic Imports**: Use Next.js’s `dynamic` import for heavy components or libraries to load them only when needed:
       ```js
       import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
       const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/HeavyComponent'), { ssr: false });
       ```
       This reduces initial bundle size and speeds up builds.[](https://dev.to/chrismbah/why-is-nextjs-so-slow-for-developers-1gl9)
     - **Analyze Bundles**: Use `@next/bundle-analyzer` to identify large dependencies:
       ```bash
       npm install @next/bundle-analyzer
       ```
       ```js
       // next.config.js
       const withBundleAnalyzer = require('@next/bundle-analyzer')({
         enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',
       });
       module.exports = withBundleAnalyzer({
         // Your config
       });
       ```
       Run `ANALYZE=true next build` to generate a bundle report and optimize large imports.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66745455/next-js-build-times-are-slow-how-can-i-make-them-faster)
   - **When to Use**: Critical for projects with many dependencies or large libraries, which likely applies given your recent issue with mixed exports.

#### 3. Optimize CSS and Tailwind Configuration
   - **Why It Helps**: Since CSS changes were a pain point in your project, optimizing CSS processing can further speed up builds. Tailwind CSS, if used, can slow builds if misconfigured (e.g., scanning `node_modules`).
   - **How to Implement**:
     - **Tailwind Config**: Ensure `tailwind.config.js` only scans necessary files:
       ```js
       // tailwind.config.js
       module.exports = {
         content: [
           './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', // Precise paths
           './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
         ],
         theme: { extend: {} },
         plugins: [],
       };
       ```
       Avoid broad globs like `../../packages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`, which include `node_modules`.[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/local-development)
     - **Update Tailwind**: Use Tailwind CSS 3.4.8 or later, which warns about slow configurations.[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/local-development)
     - **CSS Modules**: If using CSS Modules, ensure files are named correctly (e.g., `my-component.module.css`) and avoid `@import` in non-module `.css` files, as Turbopack treats `.css` as global.[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/turbopack)
     - **Minimize CSS-in-JS**: If using styled-components or Emotion, ensure proper setup (see my previous response for `_document.js` setup) and consider switching to Tailwind or CSS Modules for faster compilation.
   - **When to Use**: Essential if you’re using Tailwind or CSS-in-JS, as these were likely contributors to your CSS refresh issues.

#### 4. Enable Server Components HMR Caching
   - **Why It Helps**: React Server Components (RSC) in Next.js’s App Router can cause full page re-renders during development, slowing down HMR. Caching fetch responses improves refresh times.
   - **How to Implement**:
     - Add `experimental.serverComponentsHmrCache` to `next.config.js`:
       ```js
       // next.config.js
       module.exports = {
         experimental: {
           serverComponentsHmrCache: true,
         },
       };
       ```
     - This caches fetch responses across HMR refreshes, reducing data fetching overhead.[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/local-development)
   - **When to Use**: Useful if you’re using the App Router and Server Components, especially with API-heavy pages.

#### 5. Improve File Watching for Large Projects
   - **Why It Helps**: Your project may have many kebab-case files, suggesting a sizable codebase. File watching issues (especially on WSL2) can slow dev builds, as seen in your earlier issue.
   - **How to Implement**:
     - **Move to Local File System**: If on WSL2, move your project to the Linux file system (e.g., `~/projects`) to avoid slow `/mnt/c` performance.
     - **Increase Watcher Limits**: On Linux, increase file watcher limits:
       ```bash
       sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
       ```
     - **Use Polling as a Fallback**: If file watching is still unreliable:
       ```bash
       WATCHPACK_POLLING=true next dev --turbo
       ```
       Note that polling increases CPU usage but ensures changes are detected.[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/local-development)
     - **Exclude Unnecessary Files**: In `next.config.js`, ignore irrelevant directories:
       ```js
       module.exports = {
         webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
           if (!isServer) {
             config.watchOptions = {
               ignored: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/.git/**'],
             };
           }
           return config;
         },
       };
       ```
   - **When to Use**: Critical if you’re on WSL2 or have a large project with many files.

#### 6. Optimize Production Builds
   - **Why It Helps**: While Turbopack is dev-only for now, production builds (`next build`) can be optimized to reduce compilation time and bundle size.
   - **How to Implement**:
     - **Code Splitting**: Ensure Next.js’s automatic code splitting is leveraged by using dynamic imports (see Step 2).
     - **Optimize Images**: Use Next.js’s built-in `Image` component or `next/image` for automatic optimization:
       ```jsx
       import Image from 'next/image';
       export default function MyComponent() {
         return <Image src="/example.jpg" width={500} height={500} alt="Example" />;
       }
       ```
       This compresses images and serves modern formats (e.g., WebP).[](https://www.codingeasypeasy.com/blog/turbocharged-nextjs-supercharge-your-development-with-turbopack-a-comprehensive-guide)
     - **Tree Shaking**: Ensure unused code is removed by using ES modules and avoiding side-effect-heavy libraries.
     - **Profile Builds**: Use `--profile` to analyze production build performance:
       ```bash
       next build --profile
       ```
       Check `.next/analyze` for insights.
   - **When to Use**: Focus on these for `next build` if production deployment is slow.

#### 7. Upgrade to Latest Next.js Version
   - **Why It Helps**: Next.js 15.2 and later include significant performance improvements for Turbopack (e.g., ~50% faster compile times in 15.2 vs. 15.1).[](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1j9omtt/anyone_know_how_to_make_turbo_actually_work_it/)
   - **How to Implement**:
     - Update Next.js:
       ```bash
       npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
       ```
     - Check for breaking changes in the [Next.js upgrade guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/upgrading).
     - Test with the canary channel for the latest Turbopack fixes:
       ```bash
       npm install next@canary
       ```
   - **When to Use**: Always start with the latest version to benefit from performance fixes, especially since you’ve already cleaned up your codebase.

#### 8. Consider Alternative Runtimes (e.g., Bun)
   - **Why It Helps**: Bun is a fast JavaScript runtime that can replace Node.js for running `next dev`, potentially speeding up startup and builds. Some developers report faster dev experiences with Bun.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1c8cd57/so_turbopack_is_slower_than_webpack_what_was_the/)
   - **How to Implement**:
     - Install Bun:
       ```bash
       curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
       ```
     - Run Next.js with Bun:
       ```bash
       bun run dev --turbo
       ```
     - Test if dev server startup or HMR improves.
   - **Caveats**: Bun is less mature than Node.js, so test thoroughly for compatibility (e.g., with your dependencies).
   - **When to Use**: Experimental option if Turbopack alone isn’t enough.

#### 9. Offload API Routes (Optional)
   - **Why It Helps**: If your project uses Next.js API routes (`/api`), they can slow down builds by adding server-side compilation overhead. Offloading to a separate service can help.[](https://dev.to/chrismbah/why-is-nextjs-so-slow-for-developers-1gl9)
   - **How to Implement**:
     - Move API logic to a separate Express, Fastify, or serverless service (e.g., Firebase, Supabase).
     - Update your frontend to call the external API instead of `/api` routes.
   - **When to Use**: Only if API routes are a significant bottleneck (less likely after your Fast Refresh fix).

#### 10. Profile and Debug Performance
   - **Why It Helps**: Tools like trace files and bundle analyzers pinpoint specific bottlenecks in your build process.
   - **How to Implement**:
     - Generate a Turbopack trace:
       ```bash
       NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1 next dev --turbo
       ```
       Analyze `.next/trace.log` at [turbo-trace-viewer.vercel.app](https://turbo-trace-viewer.vercel.app/).[](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/80357)
     - Use browser DevTools to profile page load times and identify slow components.
     - Check terminal logs with verbose mode:
       ```env
       # .env.local
       NEXT_LOGGER=verbose
       ```
   - **When to Use**: If the above steps don’t fully resolve slowdowns, profiling will reveal specific issues.

### Why Turbopack Is a Top Choice
Turbopack is the most impactful solution for **development builds** (`next dev`) because:
- **Speed Gains**: Up to 96.3% faster HMR and 76.7% faster dev server startup for large apps.[](https://nextjs.org/blog/turbopack-for-development-stable)
- **Stability**: Stable for `next dev` in Next.js 15, with ongoing improvements for production builds.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1j9omtt/anyone_know_how_to_make_turbo_actually_work_it/)
- **Integration**: Built into Next.js, requiring minimal setup (`--turbo` flag).[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/turbopack)
- **Relevance to Your Fix**: Since you resolved mixed exports, Turbopack’s incremental compilation will now fully leverage your cleaned-up codebase, ensuring fast CSS and JSX updates.

However, Turbopack has limitations:
- **Production Builds**: Not yet supported (`next build` still uses Webpack).[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/turbopack)
- **Compatibility**: Some Webpack plugins or libraries (e.g., `Contentlayer`) may not work.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1j9omtt/anyone_know_how_to_make_turbo_actually_work_it/)
- **Reported Issues**: Some users report slower first-page compilation in Next.js 15.2.0+ with Turbopack, so test and profile if needed.[](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/80357)

If Turbopack doesn’t deliver the expected speed or causes compatibility issues, focus on dependency optimization, CSS cleanup, and file watching improvements.

---

### Recommended Plan
Given your recent fix and the focus on CSS changes, here’s a prioritized plan to speed up your Next.js builds:

1. **Enable Turbopack**:
   - Update to Next.js 15.2 or canary:
     ```bash
     npm install next@latest
     ```
   - Add `--turbo` to your dev script:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "next dev --turbo"
     }
     ```
   - Add `turbo: {}` to `next.config.js`.
   - Test HMR for CSS and JSX changes in `components/my-component.js`.
   - If slow, generate a trace file (`NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1`) and analyze it.

2. **Optimize CSS**:
   - Verify `tailwind.config.js` (if used) scans only necessary files.
   - Test CSS Modules or global CSS in a kebab-case file:
     ```js
     // components/my-component.js
     import './my-component.module.css';
     export default function MyComponent() {
       return <div className="test">Hello</div>;
     }
     ```
   - Update Tailwind or CSS-in-JS dependencies.

3. **Optimize Dependencies**:
   - Use `@next/bundle-analyzer` to identify large imports.
   - Replace heavy imports with specific or dynamic imports.

4. **Fix File Watching**:
   - If on WSL2, move your project to `~/projects`.
   - Test with `WATCHPACK_POLLING=true` if issues persist.

5. **Profile and Monitor**:
   - Enable verbose logging (`NEXT_LOGGER=verbose`) to confirm Fast Refresh is stable.
   - Generate a Turbopack trace if slowdowns occur.

---

### If Turbopack Doesn’t Work
Some users report mixed results with Turbopack (e.g., slower first-page compilation in Next.js 15.2.0+ or no improvement). If you encounter issues:[](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1j9omtt/anyone_know_how_to_make_turbo_actually_work_it/)[](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/80357)
- **Switch to Webpack Temporarily**: Remove `--turbo` and optimize Webpack:
  - Use `onDemandEntries` in `next.config.js` to cache more pages in memory:
    ```js
    module.exports = {
      onDemandEntries: {
        maxInactiveAge: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
        pagesBufferLength: 4,
      },
    };
    ```
   [](https://dev.to/asmyshlyaev177/solving-slow-compilation-in-dev-mode-for-nextjs-3ilb)
- **Try Bun**: Test `bun run dev --turbo` for potential speed gains.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1c8cd57/so_turbopack_is_slower_than_webpack_what_was_the/)
- **Consider Vite**: For non-SSR projects, Vite + React offers faster dev builds, but it lacks Next.js’s SSR/SSG features.[](https://dev.to/chrismbah/why-is-nextjs-so-slow-for-developers-1gl9)

---

### Conclusion
**Turbopack** is the best starting point for speeding up **development builds** (`next dev`), especially after your Fast Refresh fix, as it offers up to 96.3% faster HMR and 76.7% faster server startup. Combine it with dependency optimization, precise Tailwind/CSS configs, and file watching fixes for maximum impact. For **production builds**, focus on code splitting, image optimization, and bundle analysis until Turbopack supports `next build`. If Turbopack underperforms, use Webpack with `onDemandEntries` or test Bun.[](https://nextjs.org/blog/turbopack-for-development-stable)
