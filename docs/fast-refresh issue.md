In React and Next.js, **Fast Refresh** expects component names to follow the **PascalCase** convention (e.g., `MyComponent`) because this is a standard React requirement for identifying components. Using **camelCase** (e.g., `myComponent`) or **kebab-case** (e.g., `my-component`) for component names can cause Fast Refresh to fail, as it may not recognize these as valid React components, leading to full reloads instead of hot updates. Unfortunately, React and Next.js do not natively support camelCase or kebab-case for component names without workarounds, as PascalCase is deeply tied to React's component identification logic.

However, if most of your components are in kebab-case (or camelCase) and you want to make Fast Refresh work without renaming all your components to PascalCase, there are workarounds and considerations to address this. Below, I’ll explain why this is an issue, explore potential solutions to make Fast Refresh work with your existing naming conventions, and provide practical steps tailored to your situation.

### Why camelCase and kebab-case Break Fast Refresh
- **React’s Component Naming Convention**: React components must be named in PascalCase to be recognized as components rather than regular functions or elements. For example, `<MyComponent />` is treated as a component, while `<myComponent />` or `<my-component />` may be interpreted as a custom HTML element or ignored by Fast Refresh.
- **Fast Refresh Logic**: Next.js’s Fast Refresh relies on React’s ability to identify components. If a component is named in camelCase or kebab-case, Fast Refresh may fail to track it, triggering a full reload (as you’re seeing).
- **kebab-case Specifics**: kebab-case is particularly problematic because it’s invalid for JavaScript function names and React component names. For example, `my-component` cannot be a valid function name, so you’re likely using kebab-case in file names (e.g., `my-component.js`) but camelCase or another format for the actual component name.

### Your Situation
You mentioned that most of your components are in **kebab-case**, which likely refers to file names (e.g., `my-component.js`) or possibly the exported component names (e.g., `myComponent` or an attempt at `my-component`). Since kebab-case isn’t valid for JavaScript identifiers, your components are probably exported with camelCase names or some workaround, but the mismatch with PascalCase is causing Fast Refresh to perform full reloads. The fact that changes appear instantly via ngrok but not locally suggests that local Fast Refresh is failing due to this naming issue, while ngrok’s server-side rendering bypasses the client-side hot reloading problem.

### Can React Recognize camelCase or kebab-case for Fast Refresh?
- **Short Answer**: React and Next.js do not natively support camelCase or kebab-case for component names in a way that ensures Fast Refresh works reliably. PascalCase is a requirement for components to be recognized correctly.
- **Workarounds**: You can use techniques to keep your preferred naming conventions (e.g., kebab-case file names) while ensuring Fast Refresh works, but you’ll need to enforce PascalCase for the actual component names or use a wrapper to transform names.

### Solutions to Make Fast Refresh Work
Here are practical approaches to address your issue without fully renaming all components to PascalCase, along with steps to maintain your kebab-case file naming convention:

#### 1. Keep kebab-case File Names, Use PascalCase for Components
   - **Why**: You can keep kebab-case for file names (e.g., `my-component.js`) but ensure the exported component uses PascalCase. This is the most straightforward way to comply with React’s requirements while preserving your file naming convention.
   - **How to Implement**:
     - In each component file, use a PascalCase name for the component itself, even if the file is kebab-case.
     - Example:
       ```js
       // components/my-component.js
       export default function MyComponent() {
         return <div>Hello from my-component</div>;
       }
       ```
       ```js
       // pages/index.js
       import MyComponent from '../components/my-component';
       export default function Home() {
         return <MyComponent />;
       }
       ```
     - Ensure all imports and JSX usage use the PascalCase name (`MyComponent`).
   - **Steps**:
     1. Audit your component files for camelCase or other non-PascalCase exports:
        ```bash
        grep -r "export default function [a-z]" components/
        ```
        This finds function names starting with lowercase letters.
     2. Rename the component functions to PascalCase:
        ```js
        // Before: components/my-component.js
        export default function myComponent() { ... }
        // After
        export default function MyComponent() { ... }
        ```
     3. Update all imports and JSX references to use the new PascalCase name.
     4. Clear the `.next` cache and restart the dev server:
        ```bash
        rm -rf .next
        npm run dev
        ```
   - **Pros**: Fully compatible with Fast Refresh, minimal changes to component code, preserves kebab-case file names.
   - **Cons**: Requires updating component names and their references, which could be tedious in a large project.

#### 2. Use a Wrapper to Transform Component Names
   - **Why**: If you want to keep camelCase or kebab-case-like naming in your code, you can wrap components in a higher-order component (HOC) or export them with a PascalCase alias to satisfy React’s requirements.
   - **How to Implement**:
     - Create a wrapper function that exports your component with a PascalCase name.
     - Example:
       ```js
       // components/my-component.js
       function myComponent() {
         return <div>Hello from my-component</div>;
       }
       // Wrap with PascalCase export
       export default function MyComponent() {
         return myComponent();
       }
       ```
       ```js
       // pages/index.js
       import MyComponent from '../components/my-component';
       export default function Home() {
         return <MyComponent />;
       }
       ```
     - Alternatively, use a utility to rename exports dynamically:
       ```js
       // components/my-component.js
       export const myComponent = () => <div>Hello</div>;
       // Alias with PascalCase
       export default myComponent;
       ```
       In JSX, use `<MyComponent />` (React ignores the variable name in favor of the JSX tag).
   - **Steps**:
     1. Identify components with camelCase or non-standard names.
     2. Add a PascalCase wrapper or alias for each component.
     3. Update JSX to use PascalCase tags (e.g., `<MyComponent />` instead of `<myComponent />`).
     4. Test Fast Refresh after clearing caches:
        ```bash
        rm -rf .next
        npm run dev
        ```
   - **Pros**: Allows you to keep internal camelCase names while satisfying Fast Refresh.
   - **Cons**: Adds boilerplate, and JSX tags must still use PascalCase, which may feel inconsistent with your naming preference.

#### 3. Automate Renaming with a Script or ESLint Rule
   - **Why**: If you have many components in kebab-case or camelCase, manually renaming them is time-consuming. A script or ESLint rule can enforce PascalCase for component names or automate renaming.
   - **How to Implement**:
     - **Option A: ESLint Rule**:
       - Use the `react/jsx-pascal-case` ESLint rule to catch non-PascalCase component names.
       - Install ESLint and the React plugin:
         ```bash
         npm install eslint eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev
         ```
       - Add to `.eslintrc.json`:
         ```json
         {
           "plugins": ["react"],
           "rules": {
             "react/jsx-pascal-case": ["error", { "allowAllCaps": true }]
           }
         }
         ```
       - Run ESLint to find violations:
         ```bash
         npx eslint .
         ```
       - Fix violations manually or with an auto-fixer (if supported by your IDE).
     - **Option B: Custom Script**:
       - Write a Node.js script to rename component exports to PascalCase.
       - Example (simplified):
         ```js
         const fs = require('fs');
         const path = require('path');

         const componentsDir = './components';
         fs.readdirSync(componentsDir).forEach(file => {
           const filePath = path.join(componentsDir, file);
           let content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
           // Replace camelCase function names with PascalCase
           content = content.replace(
             /export default function ([a-z][a-zA-Z]*)\(/g,
             (match, name) => {
               const pascalName = name.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + name.slice(1);
               return `export default function ${pascalName}(`;
             }
           );
           fs.writeFileSync(filePath, content);
         });
         ```
       - Run the script:
         ```bash
         node rename-components.js
         ```
       - Update imports and JSX references manually or with a similar script.
     - **Steps**:
       1. Set up ESLint or write a renaming script.
       2. Run the tool to identify or fix camelCase/kebab-case component names.
       3. Verify imports and JSX usage.
       4. Clear caches and test:
          ```bash
          rm -rf .next
          npm run dev
          ```
   - **Pros**: Automates fixes for large projects, ensures consistency.
   - **Cons**: Requires setup and testing to avoid breaking changes.

#### 4. Adjust File Naming to Match Component Names
   - **Why**: If your kebab-case file names (e.g., `my-component.js`) are paired with camelCase component names (e.g., `myComponent`), this mismatch might confuse your workflow or tools. Aligning file names with PascalCase component names can reduce friction.
   - **How to Implement**:
     - Rename files to PascalCase (e.g., `MyComponent.js`).
     - Example:
       ```bash
       mv components/my-component.js components/MyComponent.js
       ```
       ```js
       // components/MyComponent.js
       export default function MyComponent() {
         return <div>Hello</div>;
       }
       ```
       ```js
       // pages/index.js
       import MyComponent from '../components/MyComponent';
       export default function Home() {
         return <MyComponent />;
       }
       ```
     - Use a script to bulk-rename files:
       ```bash
       for file in components/*.js; do
         newname=$(echo "$file" | sed 's/\([a-z]\)-\([a-z]\)/\1\U\2/g' | sed 's/\([a-z]\)/\U\1/g')
         mv "$file" "$newname"
       done
       ```
     - Update all imports to match new file names.
   - **Pros**: Aligns file and component names with React conventions, simplifies debugging.
   - **Cons**: Requires updating all imports, which can be time-consuming in a large project.

#### 5. Debug Fast Refresh Failures
   - **Why**: Even with camelCase or kebab-case components, you can debug why Fast Refresh is failing to confirm the naming issue.
   - **How to Implement**:
     - Enable verbose Fast Refresh logs in `.env.local`:
       ```env
       NEXT_LOGGER=verbose
       ```
     - Run `npm run dev` and check the terminal for messages like “Fast Refresh had to perform a full reload” with details about the problematic file or export.
     - Look for logs indicating component naming issues (e.g., “component is not in PascalCase”).
     - Test a single kebab-case file by temporarily renaming its component to PascalCase and checking if Fast Refresh works.
   - **Pros**: Pinpoints the exact files causing issues.
   - **Cons**: Requires manual inspection of logs.

#### 6. Accept Full Reloads for Non-Standard Names
   - **Why**: If renaming components is not feasible (e.g., due to project size or team constraints), you can continue using camelCase/kebab-case and accept that Fast Refresh will perform full reloads. This isn’t ideal but avoids major refactoring.
   - **How to Implement**:
     - Keep your current naming convention.
     - Monitor performance and ensure full reloads don’t significantly impact development.
     - Use ngrok or similar tools for testing on other devices, as you’ve found it works well.
   - **Pros**: No code changes required, leverages ngrok for instant updates.
   - **Cons**: Slower local development due to full reloads, not a long-term solution.

### Why Ngrok Works Better
As noted in your question and my previous response, ngrok’s instant updates on your phone likely stem from:
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Ngrok forces fresh SSR requests, bypassing client-side Fast Refresh issues.
- **No Local Caching**: Your phone’s browser may not cache assets as aggressively as your local browser.
- **WebSocket Stability**: Ngrok’s public URL avoids local WebSocket issues (e.g., firewall or network blocking) that disrupt Fast Refresh on `localhost`.

To align local behavior with ngrok, focus on fixing component names and checking local network issues (e.g., WebSocket connections, browser caching). Test with `http://127.0.0.1:3000` or a different browser to rule out local environment quirks.

### Recommended Approach
Given that most of your components are in kebab-case (likely file names) and possibly camelCase (component names), the best approach is **Option 1: Keep kebab-case file names, use PascalCase for components**. This:
- Preserves your file naming convention.
- Ensures Fast Refresh works by adhering to React’s PascalCase requirement.
- Requires minimal changes (only component names and JSX usage).
- Avoids complex workarounds like wrappers or scripts.

**Steps to Implement**:
1. Identify components with camelCase names:
   ```bash
   grep -r "export default function [a-z]" components/ pages/
   ```
2. Rename component functions to PascalCase:
   ```js
   // components/my-component.js
   // Before
   export default function myComponent() { ... }
   // After
   export default function MyComponent() { ... }
   ```
3. Update imports and JSX:
   ```js
   // pages/index.js
   import MyComponent from '../components/my-component';
   export default function Home() {
     return <MyComponent />;
   }
   ```
4. Clear caches and restart:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Test CSS changes in a kebab-case file:
   ```css
   /* components/my-component.css */
   .test { color: blue; }
   ```
   ```js
   // components/my-component.js
   import './my-component.css';
   export default function MyComponent() {
     return <div className="test">Hello</div>;
   }
   ```
6. If issues persist, enable verbose logging (`.env.local` with `NEXT_LOGGER=verbose`) to confirm Fast Refresh is recognizing components.

### If You Want to Keep camelCase/kebab-case
If renaming to PascalCase is not an option, **Option 2 (wrappers)** or **Option 6 (accept full reloads)** are your best bets, but they come with trade-offs:
- Wrappers add complexity and still require PascalCase in JSX.
- Full reloads slow down local development and don’t leverage Fast Refresh’s benefits.

### Additional Considerations
- **CSS-Specific Issues**: If CSS changes are still inconsistent after fixing component names, verify your CSS setup (e.g., CSS-in-JS, Tailwind, or global CSS). Ensure CSS files are imported correctly and not mixed with non-component exports (see my previous response for details).
- **File Watching**: If you’re on WSL2 or a network drive, file-watching issues could compound Fast Refresh problems. Try `WATCHPACK_POLLING=true npm run dev` or move your project to a local file system.
- **Ngrok Testing**: Continue using ngrok for cross-device testing, but aim to fix local Fast Refresh for a better development experience.

### If the Issue Persists
- **Share Details**: Provide your Next.js version, a sample component file (e.g., `my-component.js`), and your `package.json`. I can check for specific issues.
- **Search for Issues**: I can search X or GitHub for reports of Fast Refresh failing with kebab-case/camelCase components. Let me know if you want me to do this!
- **Minimal Reproduction**: Create a small repo with a kebab-case file and camelCase component to test. I can guide you through this if needed.

### Conclusion
React and Next.js don’t natively support camelCase or kebab-case for component names in a way that ensures Fast Refresh works reliably. The simplest fix is to keep kebab-case file names but use PascalCase for component names (Option 1). This aligns with React’s conventions, restores Fast Refresh, and requires minimal refactoring. Start by auditing one or two components, testing CSS changes, and verifying Fast Refresh behavior. If you need help with specific files or automating the rename process, let me know, and I can provide tailored code or scripts!


User answer:
I've checked and the following is not causing the issue:Disabled cache in the network tab- no luck
using http://127.0.0.1:3000/ instead of localhost, no luck
component files are in kebab case but component names are all in PascalCase..

Grok answer:

Thank you for the additional details! Since you've ruled out browser caching, using `http://127.0.0.1:3000` instead of `localhost`, and confirmed that your component names are already in **PascalCase** (despite kebab-case file names), we can narrow down the potential causes of the Fast Refresh issue in your Next.js project. The fact that changes (especially CSS) aren't reflecting instantly locally but work fine via ngrok suggests a specific issue with the local Fast Refresh mechanism or your development environment. Below, I’ll analyze the situation, explore remaining causes, and provide targeted steps to diagnose and fix the problem, focusing on why CSS changes are inconsistent and why ngrok behaves differently.

### Recap of Your Situation
- **Problem**: Local changes (especially CSS) require manual browser refreshes, despite Fast Refresh working previously. JSX/TSX changes may also be affected but are less consistent.
- **Working**: Changes appear instantly on your phone when using ngrok, suggesting the issue is local to your development setup.
- **Ruled Out**:
  - Browser caching (disabled in Network tab).
  - `localhost` vs. `127.0.0.1` (no difference).
  - Component naming (all components use PascalCase, though files are kebab-case, which is fine).
- **Error Context**: You previously mentioned the "Fast Refresh had to perform a full reload" error, which could still be relevant if other conditions (e.g., non-component exports) are triggering it.

### Why This Is Happening
Since component names are in PascalCase and caching/network issues are ruled out, the issue likely stems from one of the following:
1. **Non-Component Exports or File Structure Issues**: Even with PascalCase components, files with additional exports (e.g., utilities, constants) could disrupt Fast Refresh.
2. **CSS Handling Misconfiguration**: Your CSS setup (e.g., CSS-in-JS, CSS modules, Tailwind, or global CSS) might be causing Fast Refresh to fail for style updates.
3. **File Watching Problems**: Your local environment (e.g., file system, WSL2, or large project size) might be missing file changes, breaking hot reloading.
4. **Local WebSocket Issues**: Fast Refresh relies on a WebSocket connection, which could be disrupted locally but not via ngrok.
5. **Next.js or Dependency Bugs**: A bug in your Next.js version or a dependency mismatch could cause inconsistent Fast Refresh behavior.
6. **Ngrok Behavior**: Ngrok’s instant updates suggest server-side rendering (SSR) or a fresh connection bypasses local Fast Refresh issues.

### Why Ngrok Works
Ngrok’s success likely comes from:
- **SSR/SSG**: Ngrok forces fresh server-side renders for each request, bypassing client-side Fast Refresh issues.
- **No Local WebSocket Dependency**: Ngrok avoids local WebSocket issues (e.g., firewall, network blocking) that Fast Refresh relies on.
- **Different Browser**: Your phone’s browser may not have the same extensions, caching, or connection issues as your local browser.

### Steps to Diagnose and Fix
Here’s a structured approach to pinpoint and resolve the issue, focusing on the remaining likely causes:

#### 1. Check for Non-Component Exports
   - **Why**: Even with PascalCase components, files with non-component exports (e.g., utilities, constants, or non-React functions) can cause Fast Refresh to perform full reloads, especially for CSS changes.
   - **Action**:
     - Search your `components/` and `pages/` directories for files with multiple exports. For example:
       ```js
       // components/my-component.js
       export const someUtility = () => { ... }; // Problematic
       export default function MyComponent() {
         return <div>Hello</div>;
       }
       ```
     - Use a command to find such files:
       ```bash
       grep -r "export const" components/ pages/
       ```
     - Check for exports like `export const`, `export function`, or `export class` that aren’t React components or hooks.
   - **Fix**:
     - Move non-component exports to separate files:
       ```js
       // utils/someUtility.js
       export const someUtility = () => { ... };
       ```
       ```js
       // components/my-component.js
       export default function MyComponent() {
         return <div>Hello</div>;
       }
       ```
     - Clear the `.next` cache and restart:
       ```bash
       rm -rf .next
       npm run dev
       ```
   - **Test**: Edit a CSS file associated with a component (e.g., `my-component.css`) and check if changes reflect instantly.

#### 2. Verify CSS Setup
   - **Why**: CSS changes are particularly inconsistent, suggesting a problem with how Next.js handles your styles (e.g., CSS modules, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind, or global CSS). Misconfigurations can break Fast Refresh for styles.
   - **Action**:
     - Confirm your CSS setup:
       - **Global CSS**: Ensure imports are in `_app.js` or `_app.tsx`:
         ```js
         // pages/_app.js
         import '../styles/global.css';
         export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
           return <Component {...pageProps} />;
         }
         ```
       - **CSS Modules**: Check that `.module.css` files are imported correctly:
         ```js
         // components/my-component.js
         import styles from './my-component.module.css';
         export default function MyComponent() {
           return <div className={styles.test}>Hello</div>;
         }
         ```
       - **CSS-in-JS (e.g., styled-components, Emotion)**: Verify setup per Next.js docs. For styled-components:
         ```js
         // pages/_document.js
         import Document from 'next/document';
         import { ServerStyleSheet } from 'styled-components';
         export default class MyDocument extends Document {
           static async getInitialProps(ctx) {
             const sheet = new ServerStyleSheet();
             const originalRenderPage = ctx.renderPage;
             try {
               ctx.renderPage = () =>
                 originalRenderPage({
                   enhanceApp: (App) => (props) => sheet.collectStyles(<App {...props} />),
                 });
               const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx);
               return {
                 ...initialProps,
                 styles: (
                   <>
                     {initialProps.styles}
                     {sheet.getStyleElement()}
                   </>
                 ),
               };
             } finally {
               sheet.seal();
             }
           }
         }
         ```
       - **Tailwind CSS**: Ensure `tailwind.config.js` includes all relevant files:
         ```js
         // tailwind.config.js
         module.exports = {
           content: [
             './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
             './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
           ],
           theme: { extend: {} },
           plugins: [],
         };
         ```
     - Test CSS changes in a minimal setup:
       ```css
       /* styles/test.css */
       .test { color: blue; }
       ```
       ```js
       // pages/index.js
       import '../styles/test.css';
       export default function Home() {
         return <div className="test">Hello</div>;
       }
       ```
     - Edit `test.css` and check if changes reflect instantly.
   - **Fix**:
     - If using CSS-in-JS, ensure the library is compatible with your Next.js version and configured correctly.
     - For Tailwind, update dependencies:
       ```bash
       npm install tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
       ```
     - Remove any CSS imports in non-component files or files with other exports.
     - Clear caches and restart:
       ```bash
       rm -rf .next
       npm run dev
       ```

#### 3. Investigate File Watching Issues
   - **Why**: Fast Refresh depends on file system watchers to detect changes. If your environment (e.g., WSL2, network drive, or large project) overwhelms the watcher, CSS or JSX changes may not trigger hot reloads.
   - **Action**:
     - Check your environment:
       - Are you using WSL2? File watching is slower on `/mnt/c`. Move your project to the Linux file system (e.g., `~/projects`).
       - Is your project large? Many files can exceed the system’s file watcher limit.
     - Test file watching:
       ```bash
       echo "console.log('test')" > components/test.js
       ```
       Edit `test.js` and check if the terminal logs a rebuild.
     - Increase file watcher limits (Linux):
       ```bash
       # Check current limit
       cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
       # Increase limit
       sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
       ```
     - Enable polling as a fallback:
       ```bash
       WATCHPACK_POLLING=true npm run dev
       ```
   - **Fix**:
     - Move your project to a local file system if on WSL2 or a network drive.
     - Use polling temporarily to confirm if file watching is the issue (note: polling is slower).
     - Reduce the number of watched files by excluding unnecessary directories in `next.config.js`:
       ```js
       // next.config.js
       module.exports = {
         webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
           if (!isServer) {
             config.watchOptions = {
               ignored: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/.git/**'],
             };
           }
           return config;
         },
       };
       ```

#### 4. Debug WebSocket Issues
   - **Why**: Fast Refresh uses a WebSocket connection (`ws://localhost:3000`) to push updates. If this connection fails locally (e.g., due to a firewall, antivirus, or network issue), hot reloading breaks, but ngrok’s SSR bypasses this.
   - **Action**:
     - Open your browser’s DevTools (Network tab > WS) and check for WebSocket connections to `ws://localhost:3000`.
     - Look for errors like “WebSocket connection failed” or “Connection closed.”
     - Test in a different browser or incognito mode to rule out extensions.
     - Temporarily disable your firewall or antivirus to test.
   - **Fix**:
     - Allow WebSocket connections on port 3000 in your firewall.
     - Use a different port if 3000 is conflicted:
       ```bash
       npm run dev -- -p 3001
       ```
     - Test with `http://127.0.0.1:3000` in another browser (e.g., Firefox if you’re using Chrome).
     - If using a VPN or proxy, disable it temporarily to test.

#### 5. Check Next.js and Dependency Versions
   - **Why**: Bugs in specific Next.js versions or mismatched dependencies (e.g., `react`, `react-dom`) can break Fast Refresh.
   - **Action**:
     - Check your Next.js version:
       ```bash
       npm list next
       ```
     - Ensure `react` and `react-dom` match the version required by Next.js (e.g., `^18.x.x` for Next.js 13+).
     - Look for known Fast Refresh issues in your Next.js version on [Next.js GitHub Issues](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues).
     - Update dependencies:
       ```bash
       npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
       ```
     - Reinstall dependencies:
       ```bash
       rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
       npm install
       ```
   - **Fix**:
     - Update to the latest stable Next.js version.
     - Ensure no duplicate dependencies:
       ```bash
       npm list react react-dom
       ```
     - Clear caches and restart:
       ```bash
       rm -rf .next
       npm run dev
       ```

#### 6. Test a Minimal Project
   - **Why**: A minimal project can confirm if the issue is project-specific or environmental.
   - **Action**:
     - Create a new Next.js app:
       ```bash
       npx create-next-app@latest test-app
       cd test-app
       npm run dev
       ```
     - Add a kebab-case file with a PascalCase component:
       ```js
       // components/my-component.js
       import './my-component.css';
       export default function MyComponent() {
         return <div className="test">Hello</div>;
       }
       ```
       ```css
       // components/my-component.css
       .test { color: blue; }
       ```
       ```js
       // pages/index.js
       import MyComponent from '../components/my-component';
       export default function Home() {
         return <MyComponent />;
       }
       ```
     - Edit `my-component.css` and check if changes reflect instantly.
   - **Fix**:
     - If the minimal app works, compare its `package.json`, `next.config.js`, and CSS setup with your project to identify differences.
     - Gradually add dependencies or configs from your main project to isolate the issue.

#### 7. Enable Verbose Fast Refresh Logs
   - **Why**: Verbose logs can reveal why Fast Refresh is falling back to full reloads.
   - **Action**:
     - Add to `.env.local`:
       ```env
       NEXT_LOGGER=verbose
       ```
     - Run `npm run dev` and edit a CSS file. Check the terminal for logs about Fast Refresh failures (e.g., “non-component export detected” or “failed to apply update”).
   - **Fix**:
     - Address specific issues mentioned in the logs (e.g., problematic files or exports).
     - Share relevant log snippets with me for further analysis if needed.

#### 8. Investigate Ngrok Behavior
   - **Why**: Ngrok’s success suggests a local issue. Replicating ngrok’s behavior locally can help.
   - **Action**:
     - Run ngrok with the same host header:
       ```bash
       ngrok http 3000 --host-header=localhost:3000
       ```
     - Compare local and ngrok behavior in the same browser.
     - Check if your phone’s browser (used with ngrok) behaves differently locally.
   - **Fix**:
     - Use the same browser locally as on your phone.
     - Disable browser extensions or use incognito mode.
     - Ensure WebSocket connections are stable locally (see Step 4).

### Recommended Next Steps
Since CSS changes are the primary issue, focus on CSS handling and file watching, as these are the most likely culprits given your setup:

1. **Test CSS in a Minimal Setup**:
   - Create a single kebab-case file with a PascalCase component and CSS:
     ```js
     // components/my-test-component.js
     import './my-test-component.css';
     export default function MyTestComponent() {
       return <div className="test">Hello</div>;
     }
     ```
     ```css
     // components/my-test-component.css
     .test { color: blue; }
     ```
     ```js
     // pages/index.js
     import MyTestComponent from '../components/my-test-component';
     export default function Home() {
       return <MyTestComponent />;
     }
     ```
     - Run `npm run dev`, edit `my-test-component.css`, and check if changes reflect instantly.
   - **If it works**: The issue is specific to your project’s CSS setup or file structure. Compare with your main project.
   - **If it fails**: The issue is environmental (e.g., file watching or WebSocket).

2. **Check for Non-Component Exports**:
   - Search for non-component exports in CSS-related files:
     ```bash
     grep -r "export const" components/ pages/
     ```
   - Move any non-component exports to separate files.

3. **Test File Watching**:
   - If on WSL2, move your project to `~/projects` (Linux file system) and test again.
   - Try polling:
     ```bash
     WATCHPACK_POLLING=true npm run dev
     ```

4. **Inspect WebSocket Connections**:
   - Check DevTools (Network > WS) for WebSocket errors.
   - Test with a different browser or disable firewall/antivirus temporarily.

5. **Update and Clean**:
   - Update Next.js and dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
     ```
   - Clear everything:
     ```bash
     rm -rf .next node_modules package-lock.json
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```

### If the Issue Persists
- **Share More Details**: Provide:
  - Your Next.js version (`npm list next`).
  - A sample component file (e.g., `my-component.js`) and its CSS.
  - Your `package.json` and `next.config.js` (if any).
  - Any Fast Refresh logs from `.env.local` with `NEXT_LOGGER=verbose`.
- **Search for Issues**: I can search X or GitHub for recent reports of Fast Refresh failing for CSS changes in Next.js. Let me know if you want me to do this!
- **Minimal Reproduction**: Create a small repo with your setup (kebab-case files, PascalCase components, and CSS) and share it. I can guide you through this.

### Why This Should Work
- **CSS Focus**: Testing a minimal CSS setup isolates whether the issue is with your CSS configuration (e.g., modules, Tailwind, or CSS-in-JS).
- **File Watching**: Polling or moving the project addresses potential file system issues, especially on WSL2.
- **WebSocket**: Checking WebSocket connections addresses why ngrok works but local doesn’t.
- **Clean Dependencies**: Updating and reinstalling rules out version-specific bugs.

### Conclusion
The issue is likely related to your CSS setup (e.g., imports in files with non-component exports) or a local environment issue (e.g., file watching or WebSocket failures). Start with the minimal CSS test and check for non-component exports, as these are the most probable causes given your symptoms. If you share specific files or logs, I can provide more targeted fixes.
