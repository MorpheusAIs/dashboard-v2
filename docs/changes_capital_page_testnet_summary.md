# Changes Summary for Capital Page Testnet Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to implement Testnet functionality for the Capital Page in the Morpheus Dashboard, specifically focusing on the Sepolia network. The goal was to enable users to interact with the Capital Page on the Sepolia testnet, including staking, claiming, and withdrawing operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Branch Creation
- **Branch Name:** `feature/capital-testnet-sepolia`
- **Reasoning:** To isolate the development of testnet functionality and ensure changes can be tested independently before merging into the main branch.

### 2. Network Configuration
- **File:** `config/networks.ts`
- **Changes:** Added Sepolia to the list of supported testnet chains.
- **Reasoning:** To allow the application to recognize and interact with the Sepolia testnet, enabling users to perform operations on this network.
- **Code:**
  ```typescript
  export const testnetChains: Record<string, ChainConfig> = {
    sepolia: {
      ...sepolia,
      rpcUrls: {
        default: {
          http: ensureStringArray(sepolia.rpcUrls.default.http)
        },
        public: {
          http: ensureStringArray(sepolia.rpcUrls.default.http)
        }
      },
      contracts: {
        erc1967Proxy: toContract('0x7c46d6bebf3dcd902eb431054e59908a02aba524'),
        stETH: toContract('0xa878Ad6fF38d6fAE81FBb048384cE91979d448DA'),
        layerZeroEndpoint: toContract('0xae92d5aD7583AD66E49A0c67BAd18F6ba52dDDc1'),
        l1Factory: toContract('0xB791b1B02A8f7A32f370200c05EeeE12B9Bba10A')
      },
      isL1: true,
    },
  }
  ```

### 3. Dynamic Network Information
- **File:** `app/capital/page.tsx`
- **Changes:** Made the network information note dynamic based on the `networkEnv` from `useCapitalContext`.
- **Reasoning:** To provide users with accurate information about the network they are interacting with, ensuring clarity and reducing confusion.
- **Code:**
  ```typescript
  const {
    userAddress,
    setActiveModal,
    totalDepositedFormatted,
    userDepositFormatted,
    claimableAmountFormatted,
    userMultiplierFormatted,
    poolStartTimeFormatted,
    currentDailyRewardFormatted,
    withdrawUnlockTimestampFormatted,
    claimUnlockTimestampFormatted,
    canWithdraw,
    canClaim,
    isLoadingGlobalData,
    isLoadingUserData,
    userData,
    currentUserMultiplierData,
    poolInfo,
    networkEnv,
  } = useCapitalContext();
  ```

### 4. Automatic Network Switching
- **File:** `context/CapitalPageContext.tsx`
- **Changes:** Implemented logic to automatically switch networks after a successful claim operation.
- **Reasoning:** To enhance user experience by reducing manual steps required to switch networks, ensuring seamless interaction with the application.
- **Code:**
  ```typescript
  const { switchToChain, isNetworkSwitching } = useNetwork();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (claimTxReceipt && !isNetworkSwitching) {
      switchToChain(mainnet.id);
    }
  }, [claimTxReceipt, isNetworkSwitching]);
  ```

### 5. Mock stETH Address
- **File:** `config/networks.ts`
- **Changes:** Added the mock stETH token address `0x84BE06be19F956dEe06d4870CdDa76AF2e0385f5` for balance checking.
- **Reasoning:** To enable the application to correctly display the user's mock stETH balance on the Sepolia testnet, facilitating accurate testing and validation of the staking functionality.
- **Code:**
  ```typescript
  contracts: {
    erc1967Proxy: toContract('0x7c46d6bebf3dcd902eb431054e59908a02aba524'),
    stETH: toContract('0x84BE06be19F956dEe06d4870CdDa76AF2e0385f5'),
    layerZeroEndpoint: toContract('0xae92d5aD7583AD66E49A0c67BAd18F6ba52dDDc1'),
    l1Factory: toContract('0xB791b1B02A8f7A32f370200c05EeeE12B9Bba10A')
  }
  ```

## Goals
- **Enable Testnet Functionality:** Allow users to interact with the Capital Page on the Sepolia testnet, including staking, claiming, and withdrawing operations.
- **Improve User Experience:** Implement automatic network switching to streamline user interactions and reduce manual steps.
- **Ensure Accurate Information:** Provide dynamic network information and correct balance displays to enhance clarity and usability.

## Conclusion
These changes aim to enhance the Morpheus Dashboard's functionality and user experience by supporting testnet operations and improving the clarity and efficiency of user interactions.
