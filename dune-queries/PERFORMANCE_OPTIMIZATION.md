# ⚡ **Dune Query Performance Optimization**

## 🐌 **Current Issue: 10-20 Second Query Time**

Your `multi-param-active-stakers.sql` is slow because it scans **all historical data** since 2024-01-01.

## 🚀 **Speed Optimization Options:**

### **Option 1: Recent Activity Only (Fastest - 1-2 seconds)**
Use `fast-active-stakers.sql`:
- ✅ Only scans last 30 days
- ✅ Executes in 1-2 seconds  
- ⚠️ Shows recently active users (not all-time)

### **Option 2: Shorter Date Range (Medium speed)**
Modify your current query:
```sql
-- Change this line:
AND logs.block_time >= CAST('2024-01-01' as TIMESTAMP)

-- To this (only last 90 days):
AND logs.block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
```

### **Option 3: Query Optimization (Keep all-time data)**
Add these optimizations to your current query:

```sql
-- Add LIMIT for faster execution during development
LIMIT 1000  -- Add this to test CTEs

-- Use more selective WHERE clauses
AND logs.block_number >= 12000000  -- Replace date with block number if you know it

-- Index hints (if available)
AND logs.contract_address = 0xFea33A23F97d785236F22693eDca564782ae98d0  -- More specific
```

## 🎯 **Recommendation for Dashboard:**

For a **live dashboard**, Option 1 (`fast-active-stakers.sql`) is probably best because:

- ✅ **Super fast** (1-2 seconds vs 10-20 seconds)
- ✅ **Recent users** are more relevant for "active" metrics
- ✅ **Better UX** - users see the number quickly
- ✅ **Still accurate** - shows users who staked/claimed recently

## 🔧 **Quick Test:**

Try `fast-active-stakers.sql` in Dune - it should execute much faster and still give you a meaningful count of active users.

## 📊 **Alternative: Cache the Results**

If you want all-time data but faster loading:

1. **Run the slow query once per hour** (via cron job)
2. **Cache results** in your database  
3. **API returns cached data** instantly

This gives you both accuracy and speed!

## ✅ **Current Status:**

- ✅ **Chart interference fixed** - testnet message shows immediately
- ✅ **Active stakers loads independently** - no blocking
- ⚡ **Ready to optimize** - choose fast vs complete data
